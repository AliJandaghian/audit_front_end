# About This Project

This is an idea for using small auditing app in manufacturing production lines to find defects and issues. With this app managers and team leads can define a auditing form in a specific department and location and ask operators to do some audit and QC test with this app. Each department in a company has separate page in this auditing app with unlimited auditing forms which can be created by managers. 

## Advantages
- Simple and Super User-Friendly UI
- Mobile/Tablet compatibility
- Showing real-time results in each audit workspace for finding the issues in shortest time. 
- Different levels of access for data protection. 
- Using Cloud services.

For demo you can check this [Industrial-Auditing-Demo](http://industrial-auditing.herokuapp.com/).
Create an account, so you will be initially in operator role and can open your department auditing forms.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Built With
- Javascript
- React JS
- Axios
- Chart JS
- React-Router-Dom V6
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
